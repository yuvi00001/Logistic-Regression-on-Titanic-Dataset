# Logistic-Regression-on-Titanic-Dataset
In this notebook,I do analysis on the Titanic data from Kaggle, I get some insight by visualizing the data. Then I handle the missing values, the Age column had 19.86% missing values. I did prediction on Age colunm using Linear Regression to fill the missing values, finally I train a Logistic Regression model on training data and make prediction on whether a passenger would survive. Prediction is done on the testing data and accuray of the model is checked.
